## Sportspage Feeds Wrapper
This class is a custom wrapper for the [sportspagefeeds API](https://sportspagefeeds.com/documentation). 

It provides:
- Management of api key -> You can store api key locally (by default) or with a private github repo 
    so you can use the api efficiently across different hardware.
- Optionally manage api limits (on by default) 
- Methods to utilize each endpoint from sportspagefeeds
- Optionally validate input (on by default), to ensure you do not waste API calls
- Methods to get valid inputs for each endpoint, as documentation is sparse
- Methods to parse data returned by basic (non-paid) endpoints 

Quick start information below. Full documentation for this class is in development.

### API Key Management Locally
Instatiate without optional parameters and upon first use, the class will take you thru setup (copy and paste your Sportspage key)

```python
api = SportsPage()
```

### API Key Managment with Private Github Repo
Instantiate with option github parameters and Upon first use, class will take you thru setup (github token and Sportspage key). Future instantiation, just reference the github_project.
```python
# 
api = SportsPage(
    config_file_preference='github', 
    github_project='any_project_name'
    )
```

### Games
Get the games occuring today with basic schedule and odds information.
```python
api.get_games('nfl')
```

See full example response [see here.](https://github.com/lukhed/lukhed_sports/blob/main/lukhed_sports/example_responses/nflGames.json)


### Rankings
Get rankings for the given target.
```python
rankings = api.get_rankings('ncaaf')
```

See full example response [see here.](https://github.com/lukhed/lukhed_sports/blob/main/lukhed_sports/example_responses/getRankings.json)


### Check API Usage
Free tier of Sportspage is limited. You can check your api usage with this method.
```python
api.check_api_limit()

# print to console
>>>
You have 15 api calls remaining
Your reset time is set for 20241230194114 US/Eastern
Your limit is 20
```

Response
```json
{
    "limit": 20,
    "remaining": 15,
    "resetTime": "20250105194115",
    "lastCall": "20250105121251"
}
```
